# freecodecamp_tribute-page
This is an adaptation of a short project with the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design track. It was a tribute page of any one influential person of our choosing fictional or real. My background in architectural design instilled a profound admiration of the works Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Colour scheme is minimalist to evoke his signature artistic style. I included as many of the skills I had learnt at the time, even if the page may have been over-designed. This was the initial submission, however, I intend on "cleaning" up the code, using less floats and positioning, and more flexbox display, and adding functionality to it as I learn more. These are the user stories.

**User Stories**:

1. Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
2. You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
3. You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
4. Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
5. Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
6. You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
7. You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
8. Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
9. Your img element should be centered within its parent element

This was not an academic exercise. The purpose of this page was to display the skills learnt in the course so far. Below are all the links from which I gathered information.
