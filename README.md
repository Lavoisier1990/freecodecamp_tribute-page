# freecodecamp_tribute-page
This is an adaptation of a short project with the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design track. It was a tribute page of any one influential person of our choosing fictional or real. My background in architectural design instilled a profound admiration of the works Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Colour scheme is minimalist to evoke his signature artistic style. I included as many of the skills I had learnt at the time, even if the page may have been over-designed. This was the initial submission, however, I intend on "cleaning" up the code, using less floats and positioning, and more flexbox display, and adding functionality to it as I learn more.

This was not an academic exercise. The purpose of this page was to display the skills learnt in the course so far. Below are all the links from which I gathered information.
