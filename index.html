        <h3 id="headline">Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <article id="introduction">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-American architect, academic, and interior designer. Referred to as Mies in design circles, he is regarded as one of the pioneers of modern architecture. Seeking to establish his own particular architectural style that would exude modernity, his buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. This aesthetic would influence furniture design, product design, typefaces and the visual arts. He is often associated with his fondness for the aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details". Gaining the accolades of celebrated peers like Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies occupies a vaunted place within modern architecture as one of the founders of the International Style in Germany. He helped establish the International Style as the definitive architectural language of North American post-war modernism and influenced hundreds of emulators worldwide. His steel-and-glass aesthetic became the archetype of the term "modern architecture" for decades even after his death.</article>

        <figcaption id="img-caption">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was an early proponent of the Modern Movement which sought to simplify the form of design to its function. Accompanied by kindred minds, like Ludwig Karl Hilberseimer (above), this interpretation of space would inform architecture, furniture design, like the Barcelona Chair (above), and the visual arts. Exemplified with the Barcelona Pavillion and Tugendhat House, the "less is more" philosophy crystallised to become the seminal blueprint of the modern skyscraper.</figcaption>

Behrens was widely known for his commercial work in Berlin, but he also designed residences that demonstrated the new regard for classicism.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1911-14</strong> - Opened a private practice in Berlin.</li>
          <li><strong>1913</strong> - Married Ada Bruhn, a wealthy woman who bore him three daughters between <strong>1914</strong> and <strong>1917</strong>. Thereafter, he and his family lived largely on her money, leaving him free to become familiar with the Berlin artistic avant-garde and foster friendships with its more energetic members. They separated in 1921.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1919</strong> - Submitted the Kroeller-Mueller project to an exhibition of younger architects supervised by Walter Gropius, who was a determined and accomplished devotee of the modernist point of view. Mies' entry was rejected.</li>
          <li><strong>1919-37</strong> - Continued in private practice.

          <li><strong>1921-25</strong> - As Director of the architectural division in the Novembergruppe, he conceived the design of five projects that, although never built, would affect the mainstream history of 20th-century architecture. He showed models or drawings of several of these works in exhibitions, attracting the attention of the Berlin art world.

          <li><strong>1925</strong> - Mies’ work had become steadfastly modern in style, for the most part rectilinear in its contours, cubic in its massing, and open in plan whenever possible. He retained a distinctly personal fondness for brick, a material closer to the crafts tradition than to the machine aesthetic he claimed to embrace in his writings of the period.</li>

Shortly thereafter, he reopened it as a private school in Berlin.</li>

          <li><strong>1938</strong> - Emigrated to the United States and settled in Chicago, where he opened a private practice.</li>
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - Assumed the headship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology, which later became the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). He held this post until 1959. He spent the last 30 years of his life in the United States, during which he built more actively but went through fewer stylistic shifts.</li>

The Neue Nationalgalerie (1968:right) was the last of Mies' designs to be built during his lifetime.

      <p id="legacy-info">Mies’ contribution to the modern urban landscape is inescapable, whether or not one agrees with his assertion that less is more. In the same way that Gothic was expressive of the age of ecclesiasticism, so was his International Style expressive of the industrial age. Mies’ designs with their modular language endow our built environment with significance and beauty, rather than mere objects to be lived in. They radiate confidence, rationality, and elegance of their creator and, confess the essential elements of our lives. These indeed are not trivial or sterile. In our time, where excess prevails, this reductionist approach is as pertinent as ever. As we reduce the distractions and focus on the essential elements of our environment and ourselves, we find that they are great, intricate, and beautiful. Less, indeed, is more.</p>
